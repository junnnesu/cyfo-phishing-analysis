I am a banker here in Cambodia with CIMB BANK. I contacted you for this reason , one of our late customer have the same family name as yours . He died&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>
some years ago and left, 10.7 million United States dollars in his account Since then no relative have come to claim this&nbsp; money.I think we can work </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
things out,that will benefit both of us,if only you are interested.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
But unfortunately, The He died with his family in a car crash during summer holiday of 2011 in France. His account mandate does not have any contact of any </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
of his relatives as next of kin. I have made several inquiries to his embassy to locate any of his relatives without any success, I have been mandated by my </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
bank management to provide the next of kin to his account.As his account manager that If I don't get any of his relatives in 29 days the account balance of </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
$10.700,000 will be returned to the government treasury Since you have the same family name with the late account holder and I cannot find any of his </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
relatives, I now seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to the late account holder. You and I will share the money 50/50 ratio after the money </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
is transferred to you.I think this is fair decision instead of the Cambodian government taking the money. I was his personal account manager before he died </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
, I have all the vital information for us to claim the money without any problem.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>

<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
transaction properly as a professional banker and discovered that it's risk free before making contact to you.</DIV>
<DIV>
