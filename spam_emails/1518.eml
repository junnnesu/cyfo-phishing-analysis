 Hello Dear</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
I was pushed to contact you and see how best we can assist each other.I believe it is the wish of God for me to come across you now. I am having an important business discussion I wish to share with you which I believe will interest you, because it is in connection with your Kinsman and you are going to benefit from it.A citizen of your Country William Burke, had a fixed deposit with my Bank(KASIKORN BANK THAILAND) In February 2007 for 10years ,valued at US$15,500,000.00 (Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars) the due date for this deposit was last year.I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply,I sent a reminder, numerous phone calls without response and finally discovered from his contract employers,EGCO GROUP THAILAND that Sadly Mr.William Burke was among the death</DIV>

My bank management is yet to know about his death, I knew about it because&nbsp; I was his account officer.Late Mr. William&nbsp; did not mention any Next of Kin/ Heir when the account was opened, and he was not married and no children. Last week my Bank Management requested that I should give instructions on what to do about his funds, if to renew the contract.</DIV>

<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I know this will happen and that is why I have been looking for a means to handle the situation, because if my Bank Directors happens to know that William Burke is dead and do not have any Heir, they will take the funds for their personal use, so I don't want such to happen. That was why when I read your profile I was happy and I am now seeking your co-operation to present you as Next of Kin/ Heir to the account, since you are his kinsman and my bank head quarters will release the account to you. There is no risk involved; the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law.</DIV>
<DIV>
It is better that we claim the money, than allowing the Bank Directors to take it, they are rich already. I am not a greedy person, so I am suggesting we share the funds equal, 50/50% to both parties, my share will assist me to start my own company and use the proceed for charity which has been my dream.</DIV>
<DIV>
Let me know your mind on my proposal. Please,treat this information so confidential.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>
Have a nice day and God bless YOU. Anticipating your urgent response</DIV>
