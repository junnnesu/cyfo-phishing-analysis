Attention;

I am the above named person but now undergoing medical treatment in London, England. I am married to Dr. Richard Stewart who worked with British Railway Commission in Chelsea England for over a decade before he died on 5th of July in the year 2003.

We were married for fifteen years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for two weeks. Before his death he made a vow to use his wealth for the down trodden and the less privileged in the society.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of (Eighteen Million US Dollars) with one Finance House. Presently, this money is still with the Finance House. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next 150 days due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke.

Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to an individual or better still a God fearing person who will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want an individual that will use this to fund and provide succor to poor and indigent persons, orphanages, and widows and for propagating peace in the universe. I understand that blessed is the hand that give. I took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not inclined to helping poor persons and I do not want my husbands hard earned money to be misused or spent in the manner in which my late husband did not specify.

I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going.I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Almighty. I do not need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health and because of the presence of my husband?s relatives around me always. I do not want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive
your reply I shall give you the contact of the Finance House.

I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original beneficiary of this fund. I want you to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life worthy of emulation. Whosoever that wants to serve the Almighty must serve him with all his heart and mind and always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for an individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act according to specification herein. Hoping to hear from you. Thank you and May the Almighty God bless you.

Yours sincerely,

Mrs.Nancy Stewart. (Benefactor).
