<DIV>
It is with trust and confidence that i write to make this urgent business proposal to you.i was assigned by two of my colleague to seek for a foreign partner who will assist us in providing a convenient foreign account in any designated bank abroad for the transfer of us$35,500,000.00 pending on our arrival in your country for utilization and disbursement with the owner of the account.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
this amount results from a deliberate inflation of the value of a contract awarded by our ministry - the federal ministry of agriculture (fma)to an expatriate company.the contract has been executed and payment made to the original contractor,remaining the over-invoiced amount of us$35.5 million,which we want to transfer the funds out the country in our favour for disbursement among ourselves.the transfer of this money can only be possible with the help of a foreigner who will be presented as the beneficiary of the fund.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
as government officials, we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts,and this is the reason why we decided to contact you. we have agreed that if you/your company can act as the beneficiary of this fund (us$35,500,000.00 million)25% of the total sum will be for you for providing the account while 5% will be set aside for the expenses incurred during the cost of transfer of the fund into your account while 70% will be reserved for us.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
we hereby solicit for your assistance in providing a convenient account number in a designated bank abroad where this fund would be transferred.we intend coming over there on the completion of this transfer to secure our own share of the money.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
please note that we have been careful and have made all arrangements towards the success and smooth transfer of the fund to your account before&nbsp; you. for security reasons and confidentiality of this transaction, we demand that you should not expose this proposal and the entire transaction to anybody.</DIV>

&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
