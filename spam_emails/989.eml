Hi, I'm a hacker and programmer, I got access to your account johannes.olegard@cyfoexample.one.com.

Your device was infected with my private malware, because your browser wasn't updated / patched,
in such case it's enough to just visit some website where my iframe is placed to get automatically infected, if you want to find out more - Google: "Drive-by exploitH".

My malware gave me full access to all your accounts, full control over your OS and it was possible for me to spy on you over your webcam. 

I collected all your private data, recorded few videos of you (through your webcam) and I RECORDED YOU SATISFYING YOURSELF!!! 
I can publish all your private data everywhere, including the darknet, where the very sick people are and the videos of you,
send them to your contacts, post them on social network and everywhere else!

Only you can prevent me from doing this and only I can help you out, there are no traces left,
as I removed my malware after my job was done and this email(s) has been sent from some hacked server...

The only way to stop me, is to pay exactly 740$ in bitcoin (BTC).

It's a very good offer, compared to all that HORRIBLE shit that will happen if you don't pay!

You can easily buy bitcoin on the next services: paxful, coinbase or check for bitcoin ATM near you, or Google for other exchanger. 
You can send the bitcoin directly to my wallet, or create your own wallet first here: blockchain com, then receive and send to mine.

My bitcoin wallet is: 1MYJjmYScwmFfthAQNXWb5fhNMRVcAiZd
Copy and paste it, it's (cAsE-sEnSEtiVE) 
You got 72 hours time. 

As I got access to this email account, I will know if this email has been read. 
If you get this email multiple times, it's to make sure that you read it, my mailer script is configured like this and after payment you can ignore it. 
Please do not reply to this email. The sender's address is automatically generated to ensure that this email is received.

After receiving the payment, I remove all your data and you can life your live in peace like before. 

Next time update your browser before browsing the web!
