Dear Sir,

Please do not be offended receiving this email from me as we have not met before. I will start by introducing myself, I'm Bar. Greg Thompson,
I have during the course of work, held several senior and management positions and privy to confidential and top secret information as Senior
Information & Risk Analyst, Head IT & System Audit and presently the CEO Greg & Associate Chambers as an Investment & Asset Management
Attorney and the personal attorney to Engineer Gupta, a citizen of your country, formerly he works with Shell Development Company as a
contractor and he has lived all his life in West Africa.

My client died as a result of assassination by the rebels during the political uprising in my Country. Before his death, he made a deposit of
US$4.2 Million Dollars here which was for the purchase of cocoa processing machine and development of a factory before his untimely
death. furthermore his wife and his only child (son) died in a car accident few months back before his death, since this incident happened,
I have been trying to locate a member of his family to no avail, even I have made several inquiries to his embassy here to locate any of his
extended relatives to claim the fund he deposited with the bank here, this has also proved unsuccessful.

After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to look for someone who comes from the same country, continent/nation with him or who bears
the same surname with him to get his funds out of the bank here instead of losing it to the bank treasury as unclaimed fund to the Management
and I sourced your contact from an e-marketing/advertising company and had to contact you for a corresponding business opportunity which will
impact on our respective financial status in a few weeks and also proffer you more opportunity. I am willing and able to make you his Next
of kin to the above mentioned funds for possible claiming and evacuation if you are capable and competent to receive the aforesaid funds herein.
Our Sharing Ratio is 50/50 each. I contacted you to assist me in redeeming his funds valued at ($4.2 million dollars) deposited here in
the bank left behind by my late client as the Bank has issued me a notice to provide a member of his extended family abroad for the claims
or have the deposited funds confiscated.

This transaction is totally risk free and the fund is legitimate and does not originate from any illegal act. On receipt of your response I
will furnish you with detailed clarification as it relates to this mutual benefit transaction. Please do send your reply through this
email: greg4toms@gmail.com

I am looking forward to your respond for more information.

Yours Sincerely,,
Bar. Greg Thompson
Principal Attorney.
