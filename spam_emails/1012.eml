My Dear ,</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
May God Bless You abundantly.</DIV>

I am in need of your assistance but I do not know how trust worthy you are; I want</DIV>
<DIV>
to make a donation to the poor and needy through you. My name is Tony Marshall and</DIV>
<DIV>
I am an American citizen, I live in London . Right now, I am in the hospital, I</DIV>
<DIV>
have been undergoing treatment for esophageal cancer.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
I have since lost my ability to talk and my Doctors have told me that I have only a</DIV>
<DIV>
few months to live and I am very much worried about my health condition which is</DIV>
<DIV>
getting bad day by day. But I know that my redeemer liveth, he is a merciful God and</DIV>
<DIV>
he can decide to keep me longer than expected.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Before I became ill, I kept US$ 7.5 Million in a long-term deposit account in a</DIV>
<DIV>
finance company in London which I wanted to invest into long term business venture.</DIV>
<DIV>
Now that it has become obviously clear that I will not survive this cancer sickness,</DIV>
<DIV>
it is really unfortunate that I have to end my life so short.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
However, I have decided that I must give my wealth to the poor and needy just for</DIV>
<DIV>
assistance. if you can be trusted, I will like to leave the funds under your care so</DIV>
<DIV>
that you can utilize it by taking care of those in dare need of help.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Mostly, if you can donate to motherless, widows, less privileged and hurricane</DIV>
<DIV>
victims, I will highly appreciate it.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Please, kindly reply to me urgently with your full name and address, occupation,</DIV>
<DIV>
religion, including your direct telephone number so that I can give you more</DIV>
<DIV>
information. I will continue to pray about it until I hear from you. Legal documents</DIV>
<DIV>
relating to the deposit of the funds in&nbsp; London will also be made available to you.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Until I hear from you, may the Almighty God continue to bless you and give you the</DIV>
<DIV>
wisdom on how to utilize the funds when finally released to you.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Yours sincerely,</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Mr Tony Marshall</DIV>
