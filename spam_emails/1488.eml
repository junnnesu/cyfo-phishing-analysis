Hello!<br />
<br />
My nickname in darknet is conCuboss.<br />
I hacked this mailbox more than six months ago, <br />
through it I infected your operating system with a virus (trojan) created by me and have been monitoring you for a long time.<br />
<br />
If you don't belive me please check 'from address' in your header, you will see that I sent you an email from your mailbox. (johannes.olegard@cyfoexample.one.com)<br />
<br />
Even if you changed the password after that - it does not matter, my virus intercepted all the caching data on your computer<br />
and automatically saved access for me.<br />
<br />
I have access to all your accounts, social networks, email, browsing history.<br />
Accordingly, I have the data of all your contacts, files from your computer, photos and videos.<br />
<br />
I was most struck by the intimate content sites that you occasionally visit.<br />
You have a very wild imagination, I tell you!<br />
<br />
During your pastime and entertainment there, I took screenshot through the camera of your device, synchronizing with what you are watching.<br />
Oh my god! You are so funny and excited!<br />
<br />
I think that you do not want all your contacts to get these files, right?<br />
If you are of the same opinion, then I think that $500 is quite a fair price to destroy the dirt I created.<br />
<br />
Send the above amount on my BTC wallet (bitcoin): 321mn7uyfzoct3A7Rh7yuaF7XCYf3EmMzM<br />
As soon as the above amount is received, I guarantee that the data will be deleted, I do not need it.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, these files and history of visiting sites will get all your contacts from your device.<br />
Also, I'll send to everyone your contact access to your email and access logs, I have carefully saved it!<br />
<br />
Since reading this letter you have 48 hours!<br />
After your reading this message, I'll receive an automatic notification that you have seen the letter.<br />
<br />
I hope I taught you a good lesson.<br />
Do not be so nonchalant, please visit only to proven resources, and don't enter your passwords anywhere!<br />
Good luck!
