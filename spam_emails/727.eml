My Dear ,</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
May God Bless You abundantly.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
I am in need of your assistance but I do not know how trust worthy you are; I want to make a donation to the poor and needy through you.&nbsp; My name is&nbsp; Tony Marshall and I am an American citizen, I live in London .&nbsp; Right now, I am in the hospital, I have been undergoing treatment for esophageal cancer.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
I have since lost my ability to talk and my Doctors have told me that I have only a few months to live and I am very much worried about my health condition which is getting bad day by day. But I know that my redeemer liveth, he is a merciful God and he can decide to keep me longer than expected.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Before I became ill, I kept US$ 7.5 Million in a long-term deposit account in a finance company in London which I wanted to invest into long term business venture. Now that it has become obviously clear that I will not survive this cancer sickness, it is really unfortunate that I have to end my life so short.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
However, I have decided that I must give my wealth to the poor and needy just for assistance. if you can be trusted, I will like to leave the funds under your care so that you can utilize it by taking care of those in dare need of help.</DIV>
<DIV>
Mostly, if you can donate to motherless, widows, less privileged and hurricane victims, I will highly appreciate it.</DIV>
<DIV>
Please, kindly reply to me urgently with your full name and address, occupation, religion,&nbsp; including your direct telephone number so that I can give you more information. I will continue to pray about it until I hear from you. Legal documents relating to the deposit of the funds in Canada will also be made available to you.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Until I hear from you, may the Almighty God continue to bless you and give you the wisdom on how to utilize the funds when finally released to you.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Yours sincerely,</DIV>
<DIV>
Mr Tony Marshall</DIV>
