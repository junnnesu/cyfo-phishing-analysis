Urgent Help Please !


Dear Beloved.

My name is Mrs. Salimah Omar Constantine a British Merchant. I'm diagnosed
with Ovarian cancer, because it went unnoticed I had to undergo
chemotherapy. This sickness has defiled all forms of medicine, and right
now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. 
I have since lost my power of speech and can only manage to write now; as
that has been the only way I am able to communicate.

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for
anyone not even myself but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never
generous, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as
that is the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all, as I now know
that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money
in the world. I believe when the Almighty gives me a second chance to come
to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived
it.

Now that I know my time is near, I have willed and given most of my
properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as
well as a few close friends. I want nature and the Almighty God in Heaven
to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have decided to give the
remains of my wealth to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of
the last good deeds I did on earth.

So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the
Caribbean Island, Scotland my home and Ireland. Now that my health has
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself any more. I once asked
members of my family to close one of my accounts in Switzerland and donate
the money in the account to the motherless/charity homes across Africa,
Europe and America organizations, they refused and kept the money to
themselves. I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended
with what I have left for them.

The last of my money which only few of them know of is the (US$3.5M) cash
deposit that I have with a Trust Firm. I will want you to help me collect
this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations and please earn
only 20% of the money as your fee for the distribution. Please let me know
if you are interested in helping
me out.

May the Almighty God remain with you as you help.

Regards,

Mrs. Salimah Omar Constantine.
