Greetings,

It will interest you to know that I have a proposal that will be of great benefit which would further create a financial opportunity for both of us. Most importantly, I will need you to promise to keep whatever you learn from me between us even if you decide not to go along with me. I will make more details available to you on receipt of a positive response
from you.

I anticipate your urgent respond in a shortest possible time and your maximum cooperation for more details.

Best Regards,
Mr.Chan Sokheng
