Good day!

I am writing you to solicit your co-operation and partnership  in a business that would benefit us.

I want to name you as the beneficiary to my late client's estates.

I shall offer you 50 percent for your co-operation; and you will be in charge of investment.

Reply for details.

Yours sincerely,
Wynne Baxter
