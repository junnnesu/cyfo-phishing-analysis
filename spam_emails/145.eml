Good day dear,

I am very much pleased to reach you by faith believing that you will 
accept this appeal for help and investment in good faith. I am Raphael 
Kamara, the son of late Chief Vincent Kamara and I am 16 years old boy 
from Freetown Province in Sierra Leone. I am in the position of US$7.5 
Million which my late father deposited in fixed with a bank in Cote 
d'Ivoire which he wanted to use finance his presidential political 
ambition in our Country before he was affected with these deadly corona 
viruses in his business trip to France in February this year. This money 
was realized from royalties and the alluvial gold dust sold during the 
war when my father was the Chief of Freetown Province, Republic of 
Sierra Leone.

As his only child, I am presently taking refuge in Ivory Coast following 
the death of my father and my stepmother was desperately after my life 
because of my late father's wealth which he used my name as the only Son 
to deposited the money in the bank as the next of kin. I have decided to 
invest this money in your country or anywhere safe enough outside Africa 
for security and political reasons. I seek your assistance to claim this 
money and have it move out of this country to enable you assist me plan 
for the investment outside this country so as to enable plan for my 
future. I will give you 15% of the money for your kind assistance to me. 
I will give you further details as soon as I hear from you. Please, I 
wait for your response.

Best regards,
Raphael Kamara
