-- 
 From Regional Manager!

Dear Friend,

My name is Mr. Edward Wakaso I am a banker and a regional manager of a  
bank here in Ghana. I need your help to transfer a sum of 
US$7,500,000.00 into your account as my foreign partner.

The fund is part of the profits made by our bank past 4 years in the 
branch where I am the manager. I have already submitted annual report 
for last year to my bank headquarters in Accra - Ghana, and they did not 
notice the excess profits. I deposited this said US$7,500,000.00 in an 
escrow account without a beneficiary (Anonymous), to avoid any trace.

I cannot be directly connected to this fund because I'm still working 
with the bank. So, I need your help to transfer this funds into your 
account in your country for you and I to share. I offer you 45% of this 
funds as my foreign partner and 55% will be for me. There is no risk 
because it will be a bank to bank transfer. So, I want you to stand as 
the owner of this fund so that you can present a foreign bank account 
where the funds can be transferred to you as my foreign partner.

If you accept this proposal, I am prepared to go into partnership with 
you. Please kindly reply to me for more information on how to proceed.

Sincerely,
Mr. Edward Wakaso.
