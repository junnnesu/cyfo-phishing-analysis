Dear Friend,

My name is Osman Suleyman, an external auditor for the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) Central Bank in North Cyprus. So working as part of a bigger team that covers the entire region. Several details of around 1,000 bank accounts that have not been touched for 10 years or more has been made official to the general public under legal requirements which means that details of bank accounts remaining dormant for at least 10 years must be made public for collection. A total of 15 banks submitted details for the annual list to the Central Bank. An investor who is an account holder of a sect bank here remains in our records without naming any next of kin to his fund. The next of kin status has been officially certified as unknown.

The amount is Ђ11.7 Million Euros and banking regulation/legislation in TRNC demands that I notify the fiscal authorities after three years which is long overdue. The above analysis underscores my reason to seek your permission to have you stand in the gap as the next of kin and beneficiary to this funds. This funds will be approved and release in your favor as the next of kin if only you are willing to adhere to my instructions and also maintain a perfect cooperation in accordance to the directives to be given. I have all the legal and banking details of the depositor that will facilitate our replacement of your name and information as the claimant/beneficiary of the funds and then ultimately transfer the Ђ11.7 Million Euros plus interest to any bank account nominated by you. I am prepared to compensate you with an agreeable percentage of 40% share of the total funds for your participation. The final details will be given upon receipt of an affirmation of your desire to participate as the funds beneficiary.

Please contact me through my confidential email address: osman.suleyman993300@gmail.com, with the under listed details as given below:

FULL NAME, DATE OF BIRTH, TELEPHONE NUMBER, FAX NUMBER, EMAIL ADDRESS, AND POSTAL ADDRESS.

In anticipation of your fullest co-operation, I will expect your prompt response.

Osman Suleyman
