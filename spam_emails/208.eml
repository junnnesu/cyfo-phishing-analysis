Hello there!

Unfortunately, there are some bad news for you.

Some time ago your device was infected with my private trojan, R.A.T (Remote Administration Tool), if you want to find out more about it simply use Google.

My trojan allowed me to access your files, accounts and your camera.

Check the sender of this email, I have sent it from your email account.

To make sure you read this email, you will receive it multiple times.

You truly enjoy checking out porn websites and watching dirty videos, while having a lot of kinky fun.

I RECORDED YOU (through your camera) SATISFYING YOURSELF!

After that I removed my malware to not leave any traces.

If you still doubt my serious intentions, it only takes couple mouse clicks to share the video of you with your friends, relatives, all email contacts, on social networks, the darknet and to publish all your files.

All you need is $1800 USD in Bitcoin (BTC) transfer to my account.

After the transaction is successful, I will proceed to delete everything.

Be sure, I keep my promises.

You can easily buy Bitcoin (BTC) here:

https://cex.io/buy-bitcoins
https://nexo.com/buy-crypto/bitcoin-btc
https://bitpay.com/buy-bitcoin/?crypto=BTC
https://paybis.com/
https://invity.io/buy-crypto

Or simply google other exchanger.

After that send the Bitcoin (BTC) directly to my wallet, or install the free software: Atomicwallet, or: Exodus wallet, then receive and send to mine.

My Bitcoin (BTC) address is: 15PjLxvFvVuUASkWLTReBDf1SAnGboiE3Q

Yes, that's how the address looks like, copy and paste my address, it's (cAsE-sEnSEtiVE).

You are given not more than 3 days after you have opened this email.

As I got access to this email account, I will know if this email has already been read.

Everything will be carried out based on fairness.

An advice from me, regularly change all your passwords to your accounts and update your device with newest security patches.
