Hello,

I come by this message to inform you that the transaction we are about to commence is fundamentally based on trust.

I am Andrew Yaku from Estonia working with Syria Finance Security Stakeholder Contract Awarding Committee of the ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF ASIAN STATES.

I was simply inspired and motivated to pick your contact from Google directory. I wish to release the sum of $21 Million into your company's bank account. This fund was a residue of the over invoiced contract bills awarded for the supply of ammunition, hard/soft wares, pharmaceuticals/medical items, Foods, light and heavy duty vehicles, apparels and other administrative logistics etc here in Syria.

This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully protected with all the attendant loop holes sealed off as the TOP member of ECAS.

Please confirm your trustworthiness before we proceed. Reply me with your full details and phone numbers via this Email:andrewyaku@barid.com 

Sincerely,

>From Andrew
