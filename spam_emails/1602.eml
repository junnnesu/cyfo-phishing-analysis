Hello, minx!

I am a hacker who has access to your operating system.
As you can see - I sent you this email from your account.

Yes! I have full access to johannes.olegard@cyfoexample.one.com.
At the time of hacking your account(johannes.olegard@cyfoexample.one.com) had this password: password123

Moreover, I have full access to your device.

I have been watching you for several months.
The thing is, you got infected with my spyware about three months ago.

I first infected the router to which you connected to access the Internet.
Then through the router your device was infected.

If you do not understand the nuances, then I will explain
Spyware gives me full access and control over a computer or any other device.
This means that I can see everything on your screen, scan your hard drive, but you do not know about it.

I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.

Why didn't your antivirus detect malware?
The fact is that my program updates its signatures every 6 hours, so the anti-virus database does not have time to track it.

I scanned your hard drive and found enough of your frank and very sexy photos to be surprised.
Oh yeah! You are beautiful and amazing. I would not mind having an affair with you but I need the funds.

YES! With a single keystroke, I can send these photos to all your contacts in the mail, phone and social networks.
I can also publish access to all your accounts that you use, including the current one.

If you do not want to allow this, then:
transfer $672 to my bitcoin address (if you don't understand something, write to Google: "Buy bitcoin").

My Bitcoin address (BTC wallet): 1HrQYZRewTNKFSd1kVYSMyNdqppA8udfjX

After receiving the payment, I will delete all your photos and other data, and you will never see me again.
I will also launch a team that will remove my virus from your device!
I give you 48 hours (2 days) for payment.

I have a notice of this letter being read, and the countdown will work when you see this letter.

There is no point in complaining or writing anywhere, since this letter cannot be traced.
I'm never wrong!

Know that I am closely watching your device and all your accounts.
If I see that you share with someone about this letter, then all your photos and data will be instantly distributed!

Remember that if during the specified time I do not receive payment - photos and data will be instantly distributed, and your device will be encrypted!

Be clever girl!

Your respectable observer.
