Hello There,

I am a retired banker, now consulting for Investors.

The Investors are providing loan funding to anyone who has a good business/project in need 
of finance at 3% interest rate annually  with minimal documents required to conclude funding 
modalities.

Also, a fee: 1% is paid to anyone who introduces project owner for finance and we are ready 
to fund any project up to 500,000,000 EURO (five Hundred Million Euro).

I anticipate your reply.

Sincerely,
Investment Finance Group
